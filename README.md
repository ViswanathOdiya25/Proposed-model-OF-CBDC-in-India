# ðŸ’± Proposed Model of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in India

This repository presents my B.Tech thesis project on the design of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) model tailored for Indiaâ€™s economic and technological landscape.

## ðŸ§  Overview

With India's rapid digital payment adoption (e.g., UPI) and the global interest in sovereign digital currencies, this study proposes a hybrid CBDC framework. The model ensures scalability, offline access, privacy, interoperability, and alignment with Indian financial regulations.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- Designed a hybrid retail/wholesale CBDC architecture
- Supported offline transactions using NFC/QR-based approaches
- Integrated tiered-KYC to balance privacy and compliance
- Enabled smart contract-based conditional payments (e.g., subsidies)
- Ensured interoperability with UPI and other digital platforms
- Aligned with legal frameworks like the PSS Act and IT Act
